# Welcome to crwn-clothing, my learning project for learning React development!

[LIVE](https://astounding-pothos-665102.netlify.app/)

This project began as a basic e-commerce site built with fundamental React components. During its development, I progressively explored and implemented various state management techniques to enhance its functionality and performance.

## Features:

- **E-commerce interface**: Browse through clothing items, add them to your cart, and complete a purchase.
- **State management evolution**: Witness the project's journey through
    - Context API
    - Redux with basic reducers
    - Redux Persist
    - Redux with Thunk for asynchronous actions
    - Redux-Saga for managing complex side effects
- **Performance optimizations**: Discover improvements implemented at each commit stage.

## Getting Started:
- **Clone the repository**: git clone https://github.com/dhrvrm/crwn-clothing.git
- **Install dependencies**: npm install
- **Start the server**: npm run start
  
Note: *This project is still under development. Feel free to explore the code, learn from my progress, and contribute your own insights!*

## Further Exploration:

- Check out the commit history to see how the project evolved.
- Run npm run build to create a production-ready build.
- Experiment with adding your own features and customization.
- I hope you find crwn-clothing instructive and inspiring! Share your thoughts and suggestions to help me grow as a developer. I want to thanks *ZTM Academy* for this project.

Happy coding!
